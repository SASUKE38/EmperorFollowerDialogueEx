Emperor Finale Follower Dialogue Extended
=======

Allows the player to have a conversation with The Emperor when he is in the party during the finale and give him a hug
if his romance arc was completed.

## Release:
* [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12555)

# About:
This mod allows the player to converse with The Emperor when he is a follower. 
He can comment on his readiness to take on the Netherbrain and your preparation for the fight, 
and he may have additional lines based on if you are in a relationship with him and if either your avatar
or companion Karlach chose to become a mind flayer.

Some dialogue options and responses can change based on if you are playing as Avatar Karlach, the avatar was the one to assimilate Orpheus, or on the extent to which the avatar
has transformed into a mind flayer.

# Installation:
The mod can be installed with the in-game mod manager by placing the .pak file in your \AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Mods folder.
The Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager should work as well.
